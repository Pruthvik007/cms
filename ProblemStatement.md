## Spring Boot Application Catalog Management System

### Objective:

Design and implement a Catalog Management System using Spring Boot that allows
users to store and manage product data, including brand name, description, and other
relevant information.

### Requirements:

Product Entity:
Create a Product entity with fields such as id, name, brand, description, price,
quantity, category, and date added. Please add more fields related to the product. Use JPA
for data persistence.

### CRUD Operations:

Implement RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on products (GET, POST, PUT,
DELETE). Utilize Spring Data JPA repositories for database interactions.

### Search and Filtering:

Implement query parameters for searching and filtering products based on various
criteria in API endpoints.

### Data Validation:

Use validation annotations (@NotBlank, @NotNull, etc.) for input validation in the
Product entity.
Handle validation errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

### Data Persistence:

Configure and use a relational database (e.g., H2, MySQL) for data persistence.
Utilize Spring Data JPA repositories for database operations.

### Logging and Auditing:

Use logging frameworks (e.g., Logback, SLF4J) for logging. Implement auditing
features to track changes made to product data.

### Documentation:

Provide clear documentation on how to run the Spring Boot application. Include
details on API endpoints, request/response formats, and any specific setup instructions.

### Submission Guidelines:

Submit the Spring Boot project source code. Include a README file with setup
instructions and any additional notes. Specify the version of Spring Boot used and any
additional dependencies. Efficient use of Spring Boot features.
Clear and concise documentation.

### Note:

Ensure that your Spring Boot application is well-structured, adheres to best practices,
and is thoroughly tested before submission.
